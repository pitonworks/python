Assignment
Complete the take_magic_damage function. It should return the new health after calculating how much magic-type damage the player takes. Here is a description of the arguments:

health: The player's starting health
resist: The player's magic resistance. This reduces the damage they take by a static amount
amp: The attacker's magic amplification. This increases the damage they deal by a multiplier
spell_power: The base damage of the spell
First, calculate the total maximum damage to be inflicted by multiplying the spell_power by the amp. Then, subtract the resist from the total damage to get the actual damage dealt. Apply that damage to the player's health and return the new health.
